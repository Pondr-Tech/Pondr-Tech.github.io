                    <p>
                        Kenny's coding journey began when he was nine, and
                        wanted to recreate Minecraft. Yeah, his journey started
                        just like any other. But soon, he began to discover the
                        sheer power that coding has to do all sorts of awesome
                        stuff, and he started by coding up various Java games
                        and Android apps, including
                        <a
                            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kenny.animator2&hl=en_US&gl=US"
                            >Complex Animator</a
                        >, his first major release. He then went on to study
                        algorithms in the USA Computing Olympiad, ultimately
                        qualifying for Platinum in December 2020. As of now, he
                        curates his pages on
                        <a href="https://github.com/kenneth-ge">GitHub</a> and
                        and

                            >itch.io</a
                        >, where he publishes various games and projects
                        relating to his favorite topics in CS: computer
                        networking, algorithms, and computer graphics. These
                        projects often come from the Programming Club, where he
                        teaches advanced CS projects every Thursday.
                        <br /><br />
                        In his free time, Kenny loves to compose music (<a

                    <p>
                        Mihir started coding from Scratch (literally and
                        figuratively) in fourth grade, and learned Python soon
                        after. After getting a Raspberry Pi kit in sixth grade
                        he, worked on projects including automating his home,
                        and creating a self-driving car model. At school, he
                        runs the Raspberry Pi Club, which helps introduce 7-12
                        graders to physical computing. He loves to compete in
                        hackathons, which are his favorite way to learn new
                        technology. You can find him at his
                        <a href="https://github.com/0xMihir">GitHub page</a>.
                        <br /><br />
                        When he isn't coding, he enjoys playing biking, playing
                        video games, and playing the piano

                    <h2>Parker Rho</h2>
                    <p>
                        Parker has always had an interest in teaching, so Pondr
                        Tech was a naturaly way to express and explore his
                        passion in education. He loved that a single passionate
                        individual like him could design and create an entire
                        educational nonprofit -- complete with online courses
                        and a camp -- from scratch. His favorite moment from our
                        Raspberry Pi camp with Urban Legacy was being able to
                        see the concepts click physically and obviously in our
                        mentees. These moments, though small, are immensely
                        fulfilling to him because of the impact he can make on
                        the world. <br /><br />
                        Parker loves seeing how everything in the virtual world
                        interacts and playing with them in a separate dimension
                        to the real world. (Although, he loves building and
                        tinkering in the Robotics Club, too.)
                        <br /><br />
                        In his free time, Parker loves tennis, video games,
                        reading fantasy novels (currently obsessed with
                        <i>Lord of the Rings</i>) and eating and making Korean
                        food.
